# 🎮 2048-Python-Game 
A simple Python implementation of the classic game **2048**, built using the **pygame** library.

## 🕹️ About the Game
**2048** is a popular sliding tile puzzle game. I built this version in Python for fun and as a programming challenge. 

## 📝 Game Rules
* Combine tiles with the same value to create a tile with twice the value. 
* Use the arrow keys (⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️) to slide tiles. 
* The goal is to reach the **2048** tile!
